# Predicting-Earnings-Manipulation-by-Indian-Firms
Problem Statement 
Earning Manipulations by corporates has been a major concern for banks. Thus, developing a Predictive model using various Machine Learning Algorithms to help bank in knowing if any of their customers are involved in Earnings Manipulation.

Approach
The dataset is heavily imbalanced, hence I have balanced Training data using various sampling techniques and build Machine Learning models like Boosting, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Logistic & Lasso Regression with Cross Validation to identify Indian Firms that manipulated Earnings. Evaluated model performance based on the Confusion Matrix parameters like Sensitivity, Specificity & ROC.
